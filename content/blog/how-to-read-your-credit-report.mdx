# How to Read Your Credit Report (and Why It Matters)

Your credit report is one of the most important financial documents you own—yet most people never look at it. Here's why you should, and how to decode what you find.

## What Is a Credit Report?

A credit report is a detailed record of your credit history compiled by three major credit bureaus: **Equifax**, **Experian**, and **TransUnion**.

It includes:
- Payment history on all credit accounts
- Current account balances and limits
- Public records (bankruptcies, liens, judgments)
- Credit inquiries (who's checked your credit)
- Personal information (name, address, SSN)

## Why Your Credit Report Matters

Your credit report determines:
- **Loan approval** - Whether you'll get approved for mortgages, car loans, or credit cards
- **Interest rates** - Lower credit scores = higher APRs = thousands more in interest
- **Insurance premiums** - Some insurers use credit to set rates
- **Rental applications** - Landlords often check credit reports
- **Job offers** - Some employers review credit for sensitive positions

## How to Get Your Credit Report (Free)

You're entitled to **one free credit report per year** from each bureau at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com).

**Pro tip**: Request one report every 4 months from a different bureau to monitor your credit year-round for free.

## Breaking Down Your Credit Report

### 1. Personal Information
- Name, current and previous addresses, SSN, DOB, employers

**Action**: Check for errors. Inaccurate info can signal identity theft.

### 2. Credit Accounts
- Every credit card, loan, mortgage, or line of credit
- Account status (open, closed, paid off)
- Payment history (on-time vs. late)
- Credit limits and current balances

**Action**: Look for accounts you don't recognize—they could be fraudulent.

### 3. Payment History
- On-time payments: ✅ Good
- 30+ days late: ⚠️ Hurts your score
- 90+ days late: 🚨 Major damage

**Action**: Dispute any incorrect late payments immediately.

### 4. Credit Inquiries
- **Hard inquiries**: When you apply for credit (stays 2 years)
- **Soft inquiries**: Background checks (doesn't affect score)

**Action**: Too many hard inquiries in a short time can lower your score.

### 5. Public Records
- Bankruptcies (7-10 years)
- Tax liens
- Civil judgments

**Action**: These are rare but extremely damaging. Work with a credit counselor if you see these.

## Common Credit Report Errors to Look For

According to the FTC, **1 in 5 credit reports contain errors**. Watch for:
- ❌ Accounts that aren't yours
- ❌ Incorrect balances or credit limits
- ❌ Late payments you actually paid on time
- ❌ Duplicate accounts
- ❌ Closed accounts listed as open

## How to Dispute Errors

1. **Identify the error** on your report
2. **Contact the credit bureau** in writing with proof
3. **Bureau investigates** (30 days)
4. **Error is corrected or explained**

Disputing errors can boost your credit score by 10-50+ points.

## Your Action Plan

1. **Get your free reports** from all three bureaus
2. **Review every section** carefully
3. **Dispute any errors** immediately
4. **Set a calendar reminder** to check again in 4 months
5. **Monitor your credit** with free tools like Credit Karma or Experian
