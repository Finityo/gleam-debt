# Snowball vs Avalanche: Which Gets You Debt-Free Faster?

When it comes to crushing debt, two strategies dominate the conversation: **Snowball** and **Avalanche**. Both work—but they approach debt payoff from completely different angles.

## The Debt Snowball Method

The snowball method is all about **momentum**. You pay off your **smallest debt first**, regardless of interest rate. Once that's gone, you roll that payment into the next smallest debt.

### Snowball Pros:
- **Quick psychological wins** - Seeing debts disappear keeps you motivated
- **Builds momentum** - Each payoff fuels your determination
- **Simple to follow** - No complex math required
- **Great for multiple small debts** - Perfect if you have 5+ credit cards

### Snowball Cons:
- May cost more in interest over time
- Takes longer if your high-interest debts are large

## The Debt Avalanche Method

The avalanche method is **mathematically optimal**. You target the **highest interest rate first** while paying minimums on everything else.

### Avalanche Pros:
- **Saves the most money** - Minimizes total interest paid
- **Faster debt freedom** - Reduces overall payoff timeline
- **Maximizes efficiency** - Best use of every dollar

### Avalanche Cons:
- Slower initial wins if high-rate debts are large
- Requires more discipline and patience
- Can feel discouraging without quick progress

## Which Should You Choose?

**Choose Snowball if:**
- You need motivation and quick wins
- You have multiple small debts
- You've struggled with debt payoff consistency before
- Psychological momentum matters more than math

**Choose Avalanche if:**
- You're highly disciplined
- You have high-interest debt (18%+ APR)
- Saving money is your top priority
- You can delay gratification for optimal results
