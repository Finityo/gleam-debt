# Debt Manager - TODO List

## Current Focus
- ✅ Manual debt entry working
- ✅ Debt calculator with snowball/avalanche strategies
- ✅ Data persistence across sessions
- 🔄 Bug fixes as they arise

## Tomorrow's Tasks
- [ ] **Fix phone number login** - Currently not working, needs debugging
- [ ] **Add additional data sheets** - Auto-populate sheets as data is retrieved
- [ ] **Submit screenshots** for additional features/sheets
- [ ] **Automate data display** based on retrieved information

## Future Roadmap (Post-Production Access)
- [ ] **Plaid API Integration**
  - Switch from manual entry to pulling real account data
  - Get production access credentials
  - Implement automated account syncing
  
- [ ] **Automated ACH Payments**
  - Implement payment automation based on debt snowball methodology
  - This is a long-term feature

## Notes
- Waiting on Plaid production access from upcoming meeting
- Current manual entry serves as MVP/testing phase
- Focus on accuracy and user experience before automation
