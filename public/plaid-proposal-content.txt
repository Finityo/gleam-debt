PLAID PAYMENT INITIATION INTEGRATION REQUEST
Automated Debt Payment System - Finityo
Date: [Current Date]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We are developing an automated debt payment solution that helps users become debt-free by following the proven debt snowball methodology. To deliver this feature, we require access to Plaid's Payment Initiation API to enable scheduled ACH payments to creditors on behalf of our users.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
Automate monthly debt payments following an optimized payoff strategy, eliminating manual payment management and ensuring users stay on track to become debt-free.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FEATURE OVERVIEW

Our automated payment system will:

• Follow Debt Snowball Methodology
  Prioritize debts by balance while maintaining minimum payments on all accounts

• Schedule Strategic Payments
  Automatically pay each debt on its due date with the calculated optimal amount

• Roll Forward Freed Payments
  When a debt is paid off, automatically redirect that payment amount to the next priority debt

• Provide Forecasting
  Show users their exact debt-free date based on their payment plan

• Track Progress
  Monitor payment success/failure and update balances in real-time

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FROM PLAID

1. PAYMENT INITIATION API ACCESS
   • Production environment credentials for Payment Initiation
   • Sandbox access for development and testing
   • API documentation specific to ACH payment initiation
   • Rate limits and usage guidelines

2. REQUIRED API CAPABILITIES

   Capability                    | Purpose                                          | Priority
   ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------
   ACH Payment Initiation        | Transfer funds from user's bank to creditors    | Critical
   Scheduled Payments            | Set up recurring payments on specific due dates  | Critical
   Payment Status Webhooks       | Receive real-time updates on payment processing | Critical
   Balance Verification          | Confirm sufficient funds before initiating       | High
   Payment Modification          | Allow users to pause or adjust scheduled         | High
   Multi-creditor Support        | Enable payments to multiple creditors            | Critical

3. AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY
   • Production API keys (Client ID, Secret)
   • OAuth credentials for secure user authorization
   • Webhook signature verification keys
   • Documentation on security best practices for payment handling

4. INTEGRATION SUPPORT
   • Technical documentation for payment initiation workflows
   • Sample code/SDKs for Deno/TypeScript environments
   • Webhook event specifications and examples
   • Error handling guidelines and retry logic best practices
   • Testing procedures and certification requirements

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
   • Ability to schedule payments up to 12+ months in advance
   • Support for variable payment amounts per schedule (snowball methodology requires dynamic amounts)
   • Real-time payment status updates via webhooks
   • Compliance with ACH regulations and user consent requirements

IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE

PAYMENT FLOW:
1. User Authorization: User connects bank account via Plaid Link and authorizes payment initiation
2. Debt Analysis: System calculates optimal payment schedule using debt snowball methodology
3. Payment Scheduling: Edge functions create scheduled payments for each debt on due dates
4. Pre-Payment Verification: Check account balance before each scheduled payment
5. Payment Execution: Initiate ACH transfer via Plaid Payment API
6. Status Monitoring: Webhook receives payment status (pending, processed, failed)
7. Balance Updates: Update debt balances and recalculate snowball schedule
8. User Notifications: Notify users of payment success/failure via email

TECHNICAL STACK:
• Frontend: React with TypeScript
• Backend: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
• Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
• Authentication: Supabase Auth

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

COMPLIANCE & USER EXPERIENCE

USER CONSENT & CONTROL:
• Users must explicitly opt-in to automated payments
• Clear disclosure of payment amounts and schedules
• Ability to pause, modify, or cancel automated payments at any time
• Confirmation notifications before each payment is processed

ERROR HANDLING:
• Insufficient funds: Notify user and pause automated payments
• Payment failure: Retry logic with user notification
• Account disconnection: Alert user to reconnect bank account
• Creditor rejection: Log and notify user for manual intervention

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXPECTED TIMELINE

Phase                   | Duration    | Deliverables
----------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------
API Access & Setup      | 1 week      | Credentials, documentation review, sandbox testing
Core Development        | 2-3 weeks   | Payment scheduling, edge functions, database schema
